  Ancient Chinese medicine has a long history dating back thousands of years. Early Chinese people discovered that certain herbs could help treat various illnesses and promote health. Over time, they developed a systematic approach to healthcare by organizing herbs and treatments into what we now know as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

 The most important concepts in TCM are balance and harmony. According to TCM philosophy, the body is a microcosm of the universe, and health is maintained when there is a harmonious balance between opposing forces known as Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang are abstract concepts in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Yin includes the cold, deficiency, and feminine aspects, while Yang includes the hot, excess, and masculine aspects. An imbalance of any aspects in Yin and Yang can lead to illness. Understanding and restoring the balance of Yin and Yang is central to the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine, guiding diagnosis, treatment, and the promotion of overall well-being.
